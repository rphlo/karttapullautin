# Parameters for the Karttapullautin pullautus process #
#----------------------------------------------------- #

################## PARAMETERS #############################
# Experimental undergrowth parameters. Smaller figures will give more undergrowth stripes
# normal undergrowth
undergrowth=0.35

# undergrowth walk
undergrowth2=0.56

# Note, you will need to iterate this if you use this mode. with commands 'pullauta makevege' and then 'pullauta' you can process only this part again.
# Elevation for hits below green. For green mapping hits below this will be calculated as points gone trough vegetation ~ ground.
greenground=0.9
greenhigh=2
topweight=0.80
vegezoffset=0
greendetectsize=3

### Here we calculate points. We can use elevation zones and factors for green. Example:
# low|high|roof|factor
# zone1=1|5|99|1  # points 1 to 5 meters will be calculates as one hit if tallest trees there as lower than 99 moters high
# zone2=5|9|11.0|0.75 # in additon, poitns 5 to 9 meters will be calculated as 0.75 point's worth if tallest trees are lower than 11 meters.
# There can be as many zones as you like

# low|high|roof|factor
zone1=1.0|2.65|99|1
zone2=2.65|3.4|99|0.1
zone3=3.4|5.5|8|0.2


## Here we fine how sensitively we get green for different (hight or low) forest types.
# For example tf tall forest with big trees gets too green compared to low forest, we can here tune it right.
# roof low|roof high| greenhits/ground ratio to trigger green factor 1
thresold1=0.20|3|0.1
thresold2=3|4|0.1
thresold3=4|7|0.1
thresold4=7|20|0.1
thresold5=20|99|0.1

## areas where scanning lines overlap we have two or three times bigger point density. That may make those areas more or less green. Use these parameters to balance it.
# formula is:    * (1-pointvolumefactor * mydensity/averagedensity) ^ pointvolumeexponent
# so pointvolumefactor = 0 gives no balancing/effect

pointvolumefactor=0.1
pointvolumeexponent=1

# green weighting if point is the only return - these are usually boulders or such
# so these are only partly counted
firstandlastreturnfactor=1

# green weighting for last return - these may be vegetation but less likely that earlier returns
lastreturnfactor =1

firstandlastreturnasground=3
# green values for triggering green shades. Use high number like 99 to avoid some of the shades.

### hits below this will be calculated as yellow

### how big part or the points must be below yellowheight to trigger yellow
